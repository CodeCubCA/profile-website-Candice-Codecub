# Screenshot Instructions

## How to Add Your Portfolio Screenshot

1. **Take a Screenshot:**
   - Open your portfolio website in a browser
   - Take a full-page screenshot or screenshot of the main hero section
   - Recommended size: 1200px x 800px or similar aspect ratio

2. **Name the File:**
   - Save the screenshot as: `portfolio-screenshot.png`

3. **Place in This Folder:**
   - Put the `portfolio-screenshot.png` file in this `img/` folder
   - The file path should be: `c:\Users\super\Documents\projects\profile\img\portfolio-screenshot.png`

4. **Screenshot Tips:**
   - Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar)
   - Make sure the page is fully loaded
   - PNG or JPG format works
   - Higher resolution looks better

## Alternative: Use a Placeholder

If you don't have a screenshot yet, you can use a placeholder service:
- The gradient background will still look great!
- Or temporarily use a screenshot from another project

Your project card is ready and will look amazing once you add the screenshot!
